# WAITS
1.What is waits
2.Types of waits :-
 .. Auto-waiting (Built-in by Playwright)
     Playwright automatically waits for:

     Elements to be visible before clicking or typing.
     Navigation to complete after clicks that trigger page changes.
     Network requests to settle.
.. Explicit waits :-
      page.waitForSelector()
          Wait for a specific element to appear in the DOM.
      page.waitForTimeout()
          Pause for a fixed time (not recommended often, but sometimes needed)
      page.waitForLoadState()
           Wait for the page to fully load (default is load, but you can also use domcontentloaded, networkidle).
.. Assertion based waits (with expect)
      When using Playwright Test, it waits for the condition to pass within a timeout.


# POM STRUCTURE
1. What is POM STRUCTURE?
  Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in test automation that helps you:
  Organize your code better.
      Keep your locators and logic separate from your test cases.
      Make scripts cleaner, reusable, and easy to maintain.

2. Why use POM 
  2.1  Reusability	Methods like login()  ---> can be reused across tests
       Clean Code --->	Tests contain only test logic, not locators
       Easy Maintenance	 ---> If locators change, update only in the page file.
        Scalability	 ---> Works well for large projects with many pages.

3. More about POM Structure will be seen in Week 7 assignment.
